#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves systematic application of principles, methods and tools of engineering to developing high-quality software systems. It enables the creation of software solutions that power contemporary everyday life activities such as communication, healthcare, commerce etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones are defined points over the lifespan of a project; failure to meet milestones indicate that a project is not developing as intended and may activate management intervention for corrective action.
Key milestones include:
Initiation: invloves gathering of requirements, validation of expectations, approval of project.
Planning: defines a clear direction for the project and involves timeline definitions, resource definition and allocation, development team formulation 
Executing: software development, testing for quality controls, acceptance testing for users, deployment, monitoring 
Closure: passing all deliverables and paperworks to clients, project completion verification

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Plan: involves collection of requirements from stakeholders such as customers, subject matter experts, and managers to create software requirement specification document, SRSD. Planning inludes tasks such as cost-benefit analysis, resource estimation and allocation, scheduling etc.
Design: Here Software engineers analyse the provisions detailed in the requirement document and identify the best solution to creating the software.
Implement: The development team code the product by identifying from the requirement document daily coding tasks.
Test: This involves the quality analysis testing of the codes by the development team to determine presence of bugs in the software. This involves testing for errors and checking that the software meets customer requirements. Often runs concomittantly with the design phase.
Deploy: Involves a continuous testing and upgrading of the software in a separate environment known as build environment than the copy customers have access to. The deployment phase includes various backend tasks that move the latest build copy to the production environment without interfering with customer day-t0-day use of the softwaresuch as packaging, installation, environment configuration etc.
Maintain: Here, the team provide ongoing support such as fixing of bugs, resolving customer issues and management of software upgrades. The team also seek to add continuous improvement features to the software by monitoring security, user experience and system performance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model arranages all the phases sequentially, in which the completion of one phase unlocks the next and each new phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase. More suited to small software development projects with well-defined and fixed timelines and deliverables. In contrast, Agile model arranges all the phases into several development cycles where the development team iterates through the phases concurrently and rapidly producing only small, incremental changes in each cycle.It is more suited for projects where the constraints are not well understood, requiring contnuous customer feedback for iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is resposible for writing codes and developing the entire software product; also responsible for sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other team members such as QA engineer.
Quality Assurance engoneer is responsible for analyzing softwares for bugs and suggesting redemial action to make them more efficient, also confirm that the software meet requirement before deployment, create development standards and procedures for programmers to follow.
Project Manager discusses the project and its requirement with customers and software developers, assembles and leads the software development team, create the blueprint for the project including scope, setting deadlines and resource allocation, supervises and communicates the progress and important milestines for each stage of the project, delivers the completed software to the customer and regularly tracks perfomance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments help programmers develop software codes more efficiently. It increasesa developers productivity by combining capabilities such as software building, editing,testing and packaging in an easy-to-use application.May be local or cloud and examples include AWS Cloud 9, Virtual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans etc.
Version Control, also known as source control or revision control, is a source code management tool that helps developers in tracking and managing changes made to codes and other files over a given period of time. It creates a single source of truth and serves as a safety measure against irreparable damage to the source code thereby gifting programmers the privilege of experimentation without the fear of damage or creating code conflicts. It can be local, centralized, distributed or optimistic and examples inlcude Git, Mercurial and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Lack of Workflow Visibility: Invest in tools that empowers the team to make data-driven decisions such as project management tools, engineering analytics tools, observability and monitoring toolsTime limitation or constraints
Broken SDLC Processes: various engoneering management platforms are available to help mitigate potential blockers.
Lack of predictability in software delivery: automate infrastructure orchestration and management with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technologies, infrastructure monitoring and observability toolsto keep a pulse on the infrastructure health and proactively respond to infrastructure-based software challenges.
Scalabity, Security and Performance challenges: define coding standards to write scalable codes, adopt tools that empoer developers to conduct code quality reviews,use security testing tools and platforms for enhanced security.
Developer Burnouts: foster a culture of developers wellbeing, deploy DevEx surveys to assess developers feelings and comfort with the team, invest in culture of learning and reward etc.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: done at code level where individual each component is tested individually to ensure their impartiality and analyze their functionality. Automation of unit test is possible
Integration testing: tests group units integrated into a system or subsystem, helps to identify bugs or issues arising from coding errors or integration between modules. This can be automated
System testing: performed on an integrated environment comprising the entire application, where all components are assessed agaisnt defined business requirements
Acceptance testing: testing the systems functional and non-functional teatures such as performance, security, usability, accessibiity, compatibility and reliability. Can be done manually or through automation tools depending on the complexity.
Software testing is a necessary process as it guarantees that a software does what it should and meets all defined requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of structuring a an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. It is a natural language text that describes a task that an AI should perform. It helps to get the best response out of the AI assistant.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is intuitive learning. Describe step-by-step ways to developing intuitive learning to a 5-year old with easy-to-understand examples.
The improved prompt enables the AI model to return the best outcome possible for any given query.
